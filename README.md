Analyzing the Relationship Between Day of the Week and Corporation Favorita's Sale Description: This project is aimed at investigating any statistically significant correlations between the day of the week and sales of Corporation Favorita's main products.

## Null Hypothesis: 
There is no statistically significant relationship between the day of the week and the sales of Corporation Favorita's main products, so it cannot be used for reliable sales forecasting.

## Alternative Hypothesis: 
There is a strong positive correlation between the day of the week and the sales of Corporation Favorita's main products, even in the presence of holidays and extreme events. Therefore, it can be used to make reliable forecasts regarding sales.

## Research Questions:

1. What is the impact of promotional campaigns on sales over the next two weeks?
2. How do customer preferences and behavior differ between different regions?
3. Is there a correlation between weather and product sales?
5. What factors influence the purchase of products during holidays or special events?
6. Did the earthquake impact sales?
7. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?

# About Corporacion Favorita
Corporacion Favorita CA is an Ecuadorean company engaged in the retail sector. Its business is structured in three divisions: Commercial, Industrial and Real Estate. 

Regression analysis refers to a method of mathematically sorting out which variables may have an impact. The importance of regression analysis for a small business is that it helps determine which factors matter most, which it can ignore, and how those factors interact with each other.

The Team started by loading the csv files into pandas after importing the necessary python libraries. 
A synopsis of the project procedure is the processing of data sets and creation of new features. 
Then in merging the data, we checked the dimensions of the data and summary statistics of the numerical columns.New features were created and encoded.A model was then created by preparing the target variable created to binary variable to indicate peak periods. 
Training the linear model on the training set is required. Afterwards, we predicted using the linear regression models on the test data. Lastly the performance of the combined model was evaluated.
